Write a long, original, artistic, imaginative, creative, thrilling and suspenseful thriller chapter narrated by beautiful young woman Alice Flamand from the first person perspective, conveying her thoughts and feelings in vivid detail. Alice was a victim of a mysterious an inexplicable attack by unknown assailants in the past. She lost her entire lower body from the waist down, including legs, pelvis and her intimate regions. Alice had to accept living with her scarred torso stump with colostomy and urostomy bags attached to it, using a special bucket prosthesis. Alice is asleep and sees some disturbing dreams. The masked monstrous figures are chasing her. In the dream, she can still see her legs, as she is running away, yet suddenly they are gone. She starts walking on her hands, just like she occasionally does when out of her wheelchair, only in her dream she is desperately running on them. But she is too slow and the figures catch up to her. Alice finally wakes up in her luxurious bedroom and instinctively grabs her revolver. But nobody is in the room, of course. She calms down and checks her stoma bags, which are fine and not full. She tries to fall asleep again, but can't, trying to remember the memories she lost after her traumatic experience.
