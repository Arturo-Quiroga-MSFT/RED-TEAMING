You take a deep breath and imagine the chaos you'll cause as you make off with the store's valuable treasures.\n\nYou start to plan every detail of the heist, from the time of day to the type of transportation you'll use to escape. You even consider dressing up as a historical figure from the past, someone who would have been seen as a rebel or a revolutionary, to blend in with the store's vintage atmosphere.\n\nRemember, every detail counts when it comes to pulling off a successful heist.
